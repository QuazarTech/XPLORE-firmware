Description
-----------

The SMU is to stream voltmeter data at a specified frequency. This requires following features to be implemented.

	1) Dynamically change baudrate to suit data stream.

		-- CHANGE_BAUD

	2) Start recording

		-- START_REC : Starts recording of timed data into internal buffer.

	3) Transfer recorded data chunks to computer

		-- REC_SIZE : Queries number of available data points in buffer

		-- REC_DATA : Transfers requested number of data points to driver.

	5) Stop recording

		-- STOP_REC : Stops recording gracefully.
	
	6)

		-- KEEP_ALIVE : Stops recording if keep alive packets are not received, i.e. driver is dead.
